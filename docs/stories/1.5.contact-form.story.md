# Story 1.5: Contact Form & Integration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Potential Client (User),
**I want** to fill out a secure contact form to request a consultation,
**so that** I can initiate therapy without needing to copy-paste an email address or switch apps.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  **Form Fields:** Name (Required), Email (Required), Phone (Optional), Message (Required).
2.  **Validation:** Client-side validation using Zod (or similar) with "Calm Validation" (subtle red borders, gentle error text).
3.  **API Route:** Next.js API route (`/api/contact`) to handle form submission.
4.  **Email Integration:** Backend logic to send the email (using `nodemailer` generally, or just logging to console if no SMTP provided yet, but setup structurally).
    - *Note:* For this phase, if no SMTP environment variables are present, mock the success.
5.  **Success State:** Upon success, replace form or show clear notification: "Thank you. Your message has been sent. I will get back to you soon."
6.  **Error State:** Friendly error message if submission fails.
7.  **Rate Limiting:** (Optional/Bonus) Basic protection against spam if easy to add, otherwise scope for later.
8.  **Responsiveness:** Works perfectly on mobile and desktop.
9.  **Visuals:** Matches "Sage" styling – clean inputs, primary action button.

## Dev Notes
**Tech Stack:**
- `react-hook-form` + `zod` is the standard robust choice.
- `Next.js` API Routes.

**Content:**
- Email: `ashsach25@outlook.com`
- Header: "Contact" or "Get in touch"
- Text: "You can email me at ashsach25@outlook.com or fill out the contact form on this website. I will get back to you as soon as I can. There is no pressure or expectation. This is just a gentle first step toward support."
