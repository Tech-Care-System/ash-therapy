# Story 1.2: Hero & Opening Experience

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Potential Client (User),
**I want** to land on a calming, professional "Hero" section that smoothly introduces the therapist,
**so that** I feel immediately safe, welcomed, and encouraged to scroll down to learn more.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  **First Impression:** The Hero section displays the brand name "Ash Therapy & Counselling" and tagline "A safe and supportive space..." clearly.
2.  **Calm Aesthetics:** Design uses the "Sage" theme (sage green, cream, serif fonts) and includes a calming background or image.
3.  **Call to Action:** A primary "Get in Touch" button is prominent and ready for future linking (can be a dead link or anchor for now).
4.  **Scrollytelling:** The Hero text and "About Me" content do not explicitly jump; they "fade up" or slide in gently using the `FadeIn` component.
5.  **About Section:** A distinct "About Me" section follows the Hero, containing a placeholder for the therapist's bio and photo.
6.  **Responsiveness:** Both sections look excellent on mobile (stacked) and desktop (balanced layout).
7.  **Tech Stack:** Uses Next.js 16, Tailwind v4, and HeroUI v3 components. Animation powered by Framer Motion.

## Dev Notes
**Architecture References:**
- **Animation:** `FadeIn.tsx` logic described in `docs/architecture/6-component-architecture.md#a-the-fade-up-wrapper-packagesuifadeintsx`.
    - Uses `framer-motion` `useInView`.
- **Component Structure:** Follows `docs/architecture/4-source-tree-strict-monorepo-structure.md`.
    - Sections go in `apps/web/components/sections/`.
    - Shared UI goes in `packages/ui`.
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind v4 and CSS variables for colors (`var(--primary-sage)` etc.) as per `docs/architecture/5-theme-styling-strategy-the-sanctuary-look.md`.
- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, HeroUI v3 beta. `[Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack-the-source-of-truth.md]`

**Implementation Details:**
- **FadeIn Component:** Should accept `delay`, `direction`, and `children`.
- **Typography:** `Playfair Display` for Headings, `Inter` for Body.
- **Micro-interactions:** Buttons should have a subtle lift on hover (Review PRD FR3/Design Goals).
- **Images:** Use placeholders (e.g., from Unsplash) or solid color blocks if images aren't available yet.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests:**
    - Test `FadeIn` renders children.
- **Manual Verification:**
    - Scroll test: Verify elements fade in as you scroll down.
    - Responsive test: Verify layout shifts from column (mobile) to row (desktop) for Hero/About.
