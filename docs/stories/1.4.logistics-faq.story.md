# Story 1.4: Logistics & FAQ

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Potential Client (User),
**I want** to easily find practical information (Fees, Availability, Cancellation Policy) and answers to common questions,
**so that** I can feel informed and confident about the logistics before reaching out.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  **Logistics Section:** Clearly displays "Fees", "Availability", and "Cancellation Policy" in a clean, readable layout.
2.  **Online Therapy Info:** Brief section explaining Microsoft Teams usage and requirement for a quiet space.
3.  **FAQ Accordion:** Common questions are presented in an accordion format (HeroUI) to save space and allow progressive disclosure.
4.  **Smooth Reveal:** Accordion expands smoothly, and the section fades in on scroll.
5.  **Responsiveness:**
    - Logistics: Grid or stacked layout depending on screen size.
    - FAQ: Full width, accessible tap targets on mobile.
6.  **Tech Stack:** Next.js 16, Tailwind v4, HeroUI Accordion.
