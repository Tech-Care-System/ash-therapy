# Story 1.3b: Visual Polish & Refinement

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** User (Therapist/Client),
**I want** the visual design to feel "beautiful" and "decorated" rather than just functional,
**so that** the site emotionally resonates with the "Sanctuary" vibe.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  **Service Icons:** Each Service Card includes a relevant, calming icon (using `lucide-react` or similar).
2.  **Enhanced Card Design:** Cards use a "Glassmorphism" effect (`bg-white/40`, blur) instead of flat colors to feel more organic/water-like.
3.  **Approach Decoration:** The Approach section includes a visual break or decorative element (e.g., a quote block, a separator, or an icon) to reduce text density.
4.  **Typography:** Headings use a more distinct font weight or color to establish better hierarchy.
5.  **Background:** Add a background texture or additional organic shapes to fill empty space.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Setup Icons**
    - [x] Install `lucide-react` in `apps/web`.
    - [x] Update `services.ts` to map titles to generic icons (e.g., `Sun`, `Cloud`, `Leaf`).
- [x] **Task 2: Polish Service Cards**
    - [x] Update `Services.tsx`.
    - [x] Add Icon to Card Header.
    - [x] Apply `backdrop-blur-md`, `bg-white/30`, `border-white/20`.
- [x] **Task 3: Polish Approach Section**
    - [x] Add a decorative separator (SVG) between paragraphs or above the title.
    - [x] Use a "highlight" text style for key phrases if applicable.
- [x] **Task 4: Verification**
    - [x] Visual check in browser.

## Dev Notes
- **Icons:** Use thin stroke icons to match the "elegant" vibe.
- **Glassmorphism:** Requires `backdrop-filter`.

## Completion Notes
- Installed `lucide-react`.
- Implemented icon mapping in `Services.tsx`.
- Applied glassmorphism styles to Service Cards (`bg-white/60`, `backdrop-blur-md`).
- Added decorative separator to `Approach.tsx`.
- Verified changes visually and fixed a build error caused by accidental markdown syntax.
