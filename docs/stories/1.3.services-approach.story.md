# Story 1.3: Interactive Services & Approach

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Potential Client (User),
**I want** to browse the specific "Areas I Work With" and understand "How We Work Together" (Approach),
**so that** I can determine if the therapist's expertise and style align with my needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  **Service Grid:** "Areas I Work With" displays the full list of issues (Anxiety, Depression, etc.) in a clear, responsive grid.
2.  **Interactive Cards:** Hovering over a service card triggers a "Soft Lift" effect (scale up 1.05, subtle shadow, inner glow) as per spec.
3.  **Approach Section:** "How We Work Together" displays the text from content docs, formatted with a calming layout (text + possible decor/icon).
4.  **Animations:** Both sections use the `FadeIn` wrapper for a gentle entry on scroll.
5.  **Responsiveness:**
    - Services: 1 column on mobile, 2 columns on tablet, 3 columns on desktop.
    - Approach: Single column text block centered or split layout if content allows.
6.  **Tech Stack:** Next.js 16, Tailwind v4, HeroUI Card (or `div` with HeroUI styling), Framer Motion.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Create Data Structure**

    - [x] Create `apps/web/components/sections/Services.tsx`.
    - [x] Map over data to render Grid.
    - [x] Apply `FadeIn` staggering (if possible, simple FadeIn per card is acceptable).

    - [x] Verify responsiveness.
    - [x] Verify hover states on desktop and touch feedback on mobile.

## Dev Notes
