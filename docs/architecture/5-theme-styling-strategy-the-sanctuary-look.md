# 5. Theme & Styling Strategy (The "Sanctuary" Look)
To ensure the "Calm" vibe is consistent, we override HeroUI defaults at the packages/ui level.
* **Colors (CSS Variables / Tailwind v4 Theme)**:
    * `primary`: Remapped to Sage Green (via CSS variables) to replace HeroUI default.
    * `secondary`: Remapped to Clay/Terracotta.
    * `background`: Remapped to Cream/Off-White.

* **Border Radius:** Globally set to large or full (pills) to avoid sharp edges.

* **Typography:** Serif for Headings, Sans for Body.
