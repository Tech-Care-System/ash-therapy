# 1. Executive Summary
This project is a scalable, full-stack web application designed to serve as the digital presence for Ash Therapy. It uses a **Monorepo** architecture to enforce a strict separation between the "Marketing/Landing" concerns (Phase 1) and future "Application/Booking" concerns (Phase 2), ensuring code reusability and scalability from Day 1.
