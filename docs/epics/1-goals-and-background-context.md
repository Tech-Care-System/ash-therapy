# 1. Goals and Background Context

## 🎯 Goals
* **Launch a "Safe Space" Digital Presence:** Deploy a high-quality, single-page website that accurately reflects the "warm, gentle, and trauma-informed" nature of Ash Therapy.
* **Drive Engagement via "Tricks":** Implement subtle, soothing micro-interactions (fade-ins, smooth scrolling) to increase user engagement and time-on-site without causing overwhelm.
* **Streamline Inquiries:** Achieve a friction-free "Get in Touch" flow that encourages vulnerable users to reach out.
* **Ensure Technical Scalability:** Build on a robust full-stack foundation (Next.js) to allow for seamless future expansion (booking, client portal) without rebuilding.

## 📖 Background Context
Ash Therapy & Counselling is a new practice for an integrative counsellor and psychotherapist. Currently, the practitioner has no website, relying on manual contact methods which creates friction for potential clients who often need to feel "safe" and "heard" before reaching out.

The market is crowded with sterile therapy directories. Ash Therapy aims to differentiate itself by offering a digital experience that feels like a "journey"—calm, grounded, and organic. While the immediate need is a simple brochure site (Phase 1), the long-term vision includes a fully integrated practice management platform. Therefore, we are treating this not as a "website build" but as the "foundation of a web application."
