    question: "What if I feel nervous about starting therapy?",
    answer: "It is very natural to feel unsure or anxious. We will take things at your pace, and you do not need to share anything before you feel ready."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to prepare anything for therapy?",
    answer: "No preparation is needed. You can come as you are and talk about whatever feels important or present for you."
  },
  {
    question: "How often will we meet?",
    answer: "Most clients choose to meet weekly, though we can discuss what feels right for you."
  },
  {
    question: "How many sessions will I need?",
    answer: "There is no set number. Some people find a few sessions helpful, while others prefer longer-term therapy. We'll review this together as we go."

  {
    question: "Is therapy right for me?",
    answer: "Therapy can be helpful if you're feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or simply wanting a space to talk things through. You don't need to be in crisis or have a clear goal. If something is affecting you, it's enough to bring it to therapy."
  },
  {
    question: "Is everything confidential?",
    answer: "Yes. Everything you share in therapy is confidential, except in very rare circumstances where there is a risk of serious harm. We'll talk about this clearly in your first session so you know exactly what to expect."
