    question: "How many sessions will I need?",
    answer: "There is no set number. Some people find a few sessions helpful, while others prefer longer term therapy. We will review together as we go."

  {
    question: "What if I feel nervous about starting therapy?",
    answer: "It is very natural to feel unsure or anxious. We will take things at your pace, and you do not need to share anything before you feel ready."

  {
    question: "Is everything confidential?",
    answer: "Yes. Everything you share in therapy is confidential, except in very rare circumstances where there is a risk of serious harm. We will talk about this clearly in your first session so you know exactly what to expect."
